# CrochetPatternResolver

### Project Overview 
The Crochet Validity Scrutinizer (CVS) is a crochet pattern checker that Sarah Wright and Olivia Larson created. The user can input a crochet pattern and the program will reveal whether or not it is a valid pattern. For this project Sarah and Olivia only considered Beginner/ Easy patterns (eg blankets or other rectangular pieces). Additionally the set of rules that we came up with potentially could be done by a more advanced crocheter but it is unlikely that a beginner would be able to correctly attempt it, thus we made it "illegal". The set of rules that we look for in the pattern are as follows:
    - The width of the piece cannot be zero 
    - A Treble Crochet cannot be next to a Single Crochet or a Slip Stitch​
    - There can be no more than 5 consecutive spaces​
    - You cannot decrease more than two stitches together​
    - Spaces cannot be at the beginning of a row​
    - Pull through must be at the end of the pattern​
    - Cannot more than double the width in one row
    - Cannot decrease more than half the width in one row 
    - Flip and chain at the end of the row

### Problems/Challenges
While creating this program we encountered a lot of challenges. Mostly our challenges revolved around trying to figure out the best ways to implement each feature. For instance, checking that the row width for too many increases or decreases was interesting. Luckily, we were able to figure out all of our challenges and were able to complete our project. 

### How to use our progam: 
Look at the Installing files in the folder from there it will guide you. 

#### Effort
To complete this project Sarah and Olivia met up almost everyday for 2 weeks and spent about 2 hours each day planing, coding, and fixing their project. Many bugs were found along the way, thus many emails + office hours were required. All together this is about 17+ hours.
